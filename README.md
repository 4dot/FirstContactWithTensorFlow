Documentation
=============
We are using the book `First Contact with TensorFlow <http://www.jorditorres.org/first-contact-with-tensorflow-book/>`_ 
as a basic documentation. You can acces a `freely available on-line copy <http://www.jorditorres.org/first-contact-with-tensorflow/>`_ .


Prerequisite
============

In general, when you are working in Python, you should use the virtual environment virtualenv. Virtualenv is a tool to keep Python dependencies required in different projects, in different parts of the same computer. If we use virtualenv to install TensorFlow, this will not overwrite existing versions of Python packages from other projects required by TensorFlow.

For the labs, you should have a working installation of Python. TensorFlow has a Python API (plus a C / C ++) that requires the installation of Python 2.7. I assume that any student who take this course knows how to do it. 


Installation
